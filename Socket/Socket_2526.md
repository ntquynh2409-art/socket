Project Socket Programming 
Video Streaming with RTSP and RTP 
A. Describe 
In this lab you will implement a streaming video server and client that communicate using the 
Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and send data using the Real-time Transfer Protocol 
(RTP). 
Your task is to implement the RTSP protocol in the client and implement the RTP packetization 
in the server.  We will provide you code that implements the RTSP protocol in the server, the 
RTP de-packetization in the client, and takes care of displaying the transmitted video. 
1. Control Channel (RTSP Commands) → TCP 
● RTSP itself (the control protocol — e.g., SETUP, PLAY, PAUSE, TEARDOWN) almost 
always uses TCP. 
● Default port: 554 (TCP) 
● This ensures reliable delivery of control messages. 
2. Media Stream (RTP Data) → UDP 
● The actual media (audio/video) is typically transported using RTP (Real-time Transport 
Protocol). 
● By default: RTP over UDP → faster, lower latency, but may lose packets. 
Code: 
Client, ClientLauncher: 
The ClientLauncher starts the Client and the user interface which you use to send RTSP 
commands and which is used to display the video. In the Client class, you will need to implement 
the actions that are taken when the buttons are pressed. You do not need to modify the 
ClientLauncher module.  
Server, ServerWorker: 
These two modules implement the server which responds to the RTSP requests and streams 
back the video. The RTSP interaction is already implemented and the ServerWorker calls 
methods from the RtpPacket class to packetize the video data. You do not need to modify these 
modules.  
RtpPacket: 
This class is used to handle the RTP packets. It has separate methods for handling the received 
packets at the client side and you do not need to modify them. The Client also de-packetizes 
(decodes) the data and you do not need to modify this method. You will need to complete the 
implementation of video data RTP-packetization (which is used by the server). 
VideoStream: 
This class is used to read video data from the file on disk. You do not need to modify this class. 
Running the code: 
After completing the code, you can run it as follows: 
First, start the server with the command 
python Server.py <server_port> 
where server_port is the port your server listens to for incoming RTSP connections. The 
standard RTSP port is 554, but you will need to choose a port number greater than 1024. 
Then, start the client with the command 
python ClientLauncher.py <server_host> <server_port> <RTP_port 
video_file> 
where server_host is the name of the machine where the server is running, server_port is the 
port where the server is listening on, RTP_port is the port where the RTP packets are received, 
and video_file is the name of the video file you want to request (we have provided one example 
file movie.Mjpeg). The file format is described in Appendix section.  The client opens a 
connection to the server and pops up a window like this: 
You can send RTSP commands to the server by pressing the buttons. A normal RTSP 
interaction goes as follows: 
1. The client sends SETUP. This command is used to set up the session and transport 
parameters. 
2. The client sends PLAY. This command starts the playback. 
3. The client may send PAUSE if it wants to pause during playback. 
4. The client sends TEARDOWN. This command terminates the session and closes the 
connection. 
The server always replies to all the messages that the client sends. The code 200 means that 
the request was successful while the codes 404 and 500 represent FILE_NOT_FOUND error 
and connection error respectively. In this lab, you do not need to implement any other reply 
codes. For more information about RTSP, please see RFC 2326. 
The Client 
Your first task is to implement the RTSP protocol on the client side. To do this, you need to 
complete the functions that are called when the user clicks on the buttons on the user interface. 
You will need to implement the actions for the following request types. When the client starts, it 
also opens the RTSP socket to the server. Use this socket for sending all RTSP requests. 
SETUP 
● Send SETUP request to the server. You will need to insert the Transport header in which 
you specify the port for the RTP data socket you just created. 
● Read the server’s response and parse the Session header (from the response) to get the 
RTSP session ID. 
● Create a datagram socket for receiving RTP data and set the timeout on the socket to 0.5 
seconds. 
PLAY 
● Send PLAY request. You must insert the Session header and use the session ID returned 
in the SETUP response. You must not put the Transport header in this request. 
● Read the server's response. 
PAUSE 
● Send PAUSE request. You must insert the Session header and use the session ID 
returned in the SETUP response. You must not put the Transport header in this request. 
● Read the server's response. 
TEARDOWN 
● Send TEARDOWN request. You must insert the Session header and use the session ID 
returned in the SETUP response. You must not put the Transport header in this request. 
● Read the server's response. 
Note: You must insert the CSeq header in every request you send. The value of the CSeq 
header is a number which starts at 1 and is incremented by one for each request you send.  
Example: 
Here is a sample interaction between the client and server. The client's requests are marked 
with C: and server's replies with S:. In this lab both the client and the server do not use 
sophisticated parsing methods, and they expect the header fields to be in the order you see 
below.

C: CSeq: 5 
C: Session: 123456 
S: RTSP/1.0 200 OK 
S: CSeq: 5 
S: Session: 123456 
Client State 
One of the key differences between HTTP and RTSP is that in RTSP each session has a state. 
In this lab you will need to keep the client's state up-to-date. Client changes state when it 
receives a reply from the server according to the following state diagram. 
The Server 
On the server side, you will need to implement the packetization of the video data into RTP 
packets. You will need to create the packet, set the fields in the packet header and copy the 
payload (i.e., one video frame) into the packet.  When the server receives the PLAY-request from 
the client, the server reads one video frame from the file and creates an RtpPacket-object which 
is the RTP-encapsulation of the video frame. It then sends the frame to the client over UDP 
every 50 milliseconds. 
For the encapsulation, the server calls the encode function of the RtpPacket class. Your task is 
to write this function. You will need to do the following: (the letters in parenthesis refer to the 
fields in the RTP packet format below). 
● Set the RTP-version field (V). You must set this to 2. 
● Set padding (P), extension (X), number of contributing sources (CC), and marker (M) 
fields. These are all set to zero in this lab. 
● Set payload type field (PT). In this lab we use MJPEG and the type for that is 26. 
● Set the sequence number. The server gives this the sequence number as the frameNbr 
argument to the encode function. 
● Set the timestamp using Python's time module. 
Set the source identifier (SSRC). This field identifies the server. You can pick any integer 
value you like. 
● Because we have no other contributing sources (field CC == 0), the CSRC-field does not 
exist. The length of the packet header is therefore 12 bytes, or the first three lines from 
the diagram below. 
You must fill in the header fields in the header bytearray of the RtpPacket class. You will also 
need to copy the payload (given as argument data) to the RtpPacket’s payload data field. 
The above diagram is in the network byte order (also known as big-endian). Python uses the 
same byte order, so you do not need to transform your packet header into the network byte 
order. For more details on RTP, please see RFC 1889. 
Twiddling the Bits 
Here are some examples on how to set and check individual bits or groups of bits. Note that in 
the RTP packet header format smaller bit-numbers refer to higher order bits, that is, bit number 0 
of a byte is 2^7 and bit number 7 is 1 (or 2^0). In the examples below, the bit numbers refer to 
the numbers in the above diagram. 
Because the header-field of the RtpPacket class is of type bytearray, you will need to set the 
header one byte at a time, that is, in groups of 8 bits. The first byte has bits 0-7, the second byte 
has bits 8-15, and so on. 
To set bit number n in variable mybyte of type byte: 
mybyte = mybyte | 1 << (7 - n) 
To set bits n and n + 1 to the value of foo in variable mybyte: 
mybyte = mybyte | foo << (7 - n) 
Note that foo must have a value that can be expressed with 2 bits, that is, 0, 1, 2, or 3. 
To copy a 16-bit integer foo into 2 bytes, b1 and b2: 
b1 = (foo >> 8) & 0xFF 
b2 = foo & 0xFF 
After this, b1 will have the 8 high-order bits of foo and b2 will have the 8 low-order bits of foo. 
You can copy a 32-bit integer into 4 bytes in a similar way. 
Bit Example 
Suppose we want to fill in the first byte of the RTP packet header with the following values: 
V = 2, P = 0, X = 0, CC = 3 
In binary this would be represented as  
1 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 0 1 1 
V=2  P  X   CC = 3 
2^7 . . . . . . . . 2^0

Appendix 
1. Lab’s proprietary MJPEG (Motion JPEG) format 
In this lab, the server streams a video which has been encoded into a proprietary MJPEG file 
format. This format stores the video as concatenated JPEG-encoded images, with each image 
being preceded by a 5-Byte header which indicates the bit size of the image. The server parses 
the bitstream of the MJPEG file to extract the JPEG images on the fly. The server sends the 
images to the client at periodic intervals. The client then displays the individual JPEG images as 
they arrive from the server. (movie.Mjpeg)
